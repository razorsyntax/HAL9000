# Demo Assets

This folder contains assets used only by the demo (`demo/index.html` and root `index.html` for GitHub Pages).

These files are **not part of the HAL9000 library** - they're only used for the interactive demo.

- `angular.min.js` - AngularJS framework for demo UI
- `nnApp.js` - Demo-specific Angular application code
