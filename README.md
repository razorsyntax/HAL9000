# HAL9000
JavaScript based Neural Network 

This network works but it's shaky at the moment.  Check the Index.html for testing regime.

###### The idea behind this Neural Network is ease of use and customization. The toolset will grow over time.

###### The Network is represented by a dynamically updating JSON obj.

Notes: 
* This library depends on math.js to for its matrix math.
* index.html has some basic use case tests- this will grow as the library expands
    
    
Future Tasks:
* Add to npm
* Integration with a JavaScript GPU library for crunching larger data sets
