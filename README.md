# HAL9000
JavaScript based Neural Network

This contains the preliminary work and isn't currently useable.

The idea behind this Neural Network is ease of use.
   1) Define inputs
   2) Create a neuron
   3) Get data

This will include an ever expanding set of tools to customize your Neural Network.

The Network is represented by a dynamically updating JSON obj.

Notes: 
    * This library depends on math.js to for its matrix math.
    * index.html has some basic use case tests- this will grow as the library expands
    
    
Future Tasks:
    * Add to npm
    * Integration with a JavaScript GPU library for crunching larger data sets
